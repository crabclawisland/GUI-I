                        This is the working index of Alex Nevers for GUI I (91.461) at UML. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I am a Senior Computer Science Major at UMass Lowell. This is my first real foray into GUI or web design of any kind, which may be obvious. I had one previous unprofessional attempt at creating a brain-themed website early in high school, which can be found <a href="http://project-files.internaldrive.com/mit/07-10-15-2011/web/AlexN/index.html">here</a>.
                        Which leads me to feel a bit out of my depth at this class, but Kurt Vonnegut puts it best:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Almost nobody's competent, Paul. It's enough to make you cry to see how bad most people are at their jobs. If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you're a one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind." 
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        More of my information can be found on the contact page. The rest of the pages are place holders until more assignments are given.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Here are some other long quotes to pad my page for length, to test scrolling properties:</P>

                    <blockquote> 
                        "Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing. And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter... Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold... that is the crowning unlikelihood. The thermodynamic miracle." </blockquote>
